# About the Little Review (a modernist magazine created in 1914)
The Little Review  is a literary periodical found by Margaret Anderson in 1914 in Chicago, United States. 

The Little Review, along with Harriet Monroe’s Poetry and many other magazines found in the same period with a focus on literature and arts, are known as “little magazines” that served an important part in the communication between writers of the British and American literary modernism . 

The ties between editors, contributors, and readers of these little magazines are close-—many writers served as editors and book reviewers for the magazines, editors created contents, and many readers were artists, writers, and critics themselves. 

# Goal of this project
To investigate the editorial focus of the Little Review and its shift of focus through time. 

This project is divided into three parts: the first part looks at the genre distribution within the magazine and its changes; the second part uses network analysis to investigate the review network and the author-genre network; the third part looks at the most frequent words in Little Review’s fictions, and compares the words to three topics modelled by the Modernist Versions Project from 23 canonical modernist fictions. 

Through the adoption of these different methods, this project sets out to find new and constructive ways of visualizing and text mining data from the humanities discipline, and critically reviews the possible restraints of the methods.
