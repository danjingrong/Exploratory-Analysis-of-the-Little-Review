# Exploratory-Analysis-of-the-Little-Review
Extract editorial information(authors, genres, dates...) from HTML file of the Little Review, a modernist literature magazine in the 1920s, and analyze the editor's preferred genres, and writers with progression of time. 

# About the Little Review (a modernist magazine created in 1914)
The Little Review  is a literary periodical found by Margaret Anderson in 1914 in Chicago, United States. 

The Little Review, along with Harriet Monroe’s Poetry and many other magazines found in the same period with a focus on literature and arts, are known as “little magazines” that served an important part in the communication between writers of the British and American literary modernism . 

The ties between editors, contributors, and readers of these little magazines are close-—many writers served as editors and book reviewers for the magazines, editors created contents, and many readers were artists, writers, and critics themselves. 

# Goal of this project
To investigate the editorial focus of the Little Review and its shift of focus through time. 

This project is divided into three parts: the first part looks at the genre distribution within the magazine and its changes; the second part uses network analysis to investigate the review network and the author-genre network; the third part looks at the most frequent words in Little Review’s fictions, and compares the words to three topics modelled by the Modernist Versions Project from 23 canonical modernist fictions. 

Through the adoption of these different methods, this project sets out to find new and constructive ways of visualizing and text mining data from the humanities discipline, and critically reviews the possible restraints of the methods. 

# Genre and Author Distribution

The articles genre, which contains book reviews, quotes, announcements, and essays is the largest category, mounting to over 1000 titles.

Poetry ranks the second, letters the third, and fiction the fourth. The large size of poetry and articles can be partly attributed to their relatively shorter length, which makes it easier for the editor to publish more poetry than fiction. One page can contain as many as 10 single-sentence reviews.  

Nevertheless, the large amount for articles and poetry reveals that the editor’s wish to prioritize critical discussion on arts and literature in this magazine, and poetry is seen as a very important form of literature to conduct formal and content exploration.

Articles experienced a sharp decrease from over 1,000 entries to around 100 entries in two years.

The decrease indicates that the editor of the magazine decides to turn away from a very heavy focus on critical discourse, and to give more space for creative works. 

Fiction did not appear until fifth issue of the first volume.

Poetry starts its largest decrease from the fifth volume, when the number of fictions starts to rise rapidly.

The radical growth for images happens at the eighth volume, when almost every other genre witnesses a decrease in numbers.

The decrease is partly due to the magazine’s transition from monthly to quarterly in the autumn of 1921, which brings down the numbers for all entries. The surge of images, considering this general decrease in numbers, appears all the more dramatic. One reason for this surge is that the magazine is turning its focus onto visual arts, publishing artworks from the Avant Garde groups such as Dadaists. Data from after the eighth volume would be helpful to see if the dominance of images persists.
